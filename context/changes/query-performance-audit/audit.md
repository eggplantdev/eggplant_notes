# Query / fetch performance audit

**Date:** 2026-06-07
**Scope:** every Supabase read across the app (all `queries.ts`, the actions that read, and the
route/component consumers that decide what gets fetched). Driven by the TODO:

> Stop over-fetching: select only needed columns (notes list pulls full objects/`content` but
> renders titles).

**Method:** read each query, traced it to its consumer(s), checked the selected columns against the
columns actually rendered/used, and cross-checked ordering/filtering against the DB indexes in
`supabase/migrations/`.

---

## Headline verdict: the TODO is already done

`getNotes` (`src/features/notes/queries.ts:31`) already selects only
`id, title, created_at, subjects(title)` — **never `content`** — and its return type
`NoteListItemT` (`src/features/notes/types.ts:5`) is a `Pick`. This was fixed on **2026-06-06** in
commit `8878f6d` ("feat(list-search-pagination): data layer — slim, paginate, search (p1)"), after
the TODO was written.

➡️ **Action: tick the TODO item off — no code change needed for the notes list.**

The same slimming was applied consistently to the other list reads:

| Query                     | Selects                                                                         | Renders                     | Verdict                                                                 |

## Findings (remaining, all low / informational)

### F1 — `getSubjects()` selects `*`, every consumer uses only `id` + `title` — LOW (real over-fetch)

`src/features/subjects/queries.ts:17` does `select('*')` and returns `SubjectT[]`. All six callers
consume only `id` and `title`:

- `notes/page.tsx:30` → `{ value: id, label: title }` filter options
- `memory-cards/page.tsx:54` → same
- `notes/components/note-form.tsx:61` → `<select>` options
- `memory-cards/components/card-form.tsx:66` → `<select>` options
- `notes/new/page.tsx:14` → `subjects.some(s => s.id === …)`
- `notes/[id]/page.tsx:39` → `subjects.find(s => s.id === …)` (and see F2)

So `description` + `created_at` are pulled for every subject and never read. Same class of bug as
the TODO, smaller magnitude (short text + a timestamp, vs note `content`).

**Proposed fix** (was started, not applied):

1. Add `SubjectOptionT = Pick<SubjectT, 'id' | 'title'>` to `src/features/subjects/types.ts`.
2. Narrow `getSubjects()` to `select('id, title')` → returns `SubjectOptionT[]`.
3. Update the two form prop types `subjects: SubjectT[]` → `SubjectOptionT[]`
   (`note-form.tsx:35` and `:45`, `card-form.tsx:40`).

Risk: low. No consumer reads the dropped columns. Touches 1 query + 1 type file + 2 form files.

### F2 — `notes/[id]/page.tsx` read mode fetches ALL subjects to resolve ONE title — LOW

`notes/[id]/page.tsx:30-34` always fetches `getSubjects()` (whole list) in parallel, but in **read**
mode it uses it only to resolve `note.subject_id` → the subject's title for the eyebrow link
(`:39`). The full list is genuinely needed only in **edit** mode (the form picker). `edit` is known
before the fetch.

Marginal once F1 lands (the payload is then just `id`+`title` for all subjects). Options: leave it
(simplest, parallel fetch is cheap at personal scale), or fetch a single subject in read mode. Lean
toward **leave** unless subject counts grow — flag only.

### F3 — text search does an un-indexed `ilike` over large columns — INFORMATIONAL (scale)

`getNotes` searches `or(title ilike, content ilike)` and `getMemoryCardsList` searches
`prompt/example/code_context`. `content` and the card answer columns are unindexed text, so each
search is a full-table `ILIKE` scan. Fine at personal scale (tens–hundreds of rows); the thing to
revisit first if data grows is a `pg_trgm` GIN index or a `tsvector` full-text column. No action now.

### F4 — review-events time-window reads have no `(user_id, reviewed_at)` index — INFORMATIONAL

`getReviewActivity` (400d), `getReviewsThisWeekCount` (8d), `getReviewedTodayCount` (2d) filter
`reviewed_at >= since` with only `review_events_user_id_idx` (user_id alone). Windows are explicitly
bounded, so the scan is tiny. A composite `(user_id, reviewed_at)` index would help only at much
larger history sizes. No action now.

### F5 — whole-table "fetch-all, aggregate in TS" stats reads — INFORMATIONAL (by design)

`getCardsForStats`, `getNotesForStats`, `getReviewActivity` deliberately fetch the full owned set and
bucket/count in TypeScript, because PostgREST can't `GROUP BY` an `APP_TIME_ZONE`-shifted date in a
plain select. Documented in-code and justified at personal scale. This is the first place to revisit
(move aggregation into a Postgres RPC / SQL view) if a user ever accumulates thousands of cards. No
action now.

---

## Verified clean (no change)

- **No N+1.** Embedded selects (`subjects(title)`, `notes(title)`) are single PostgREST joined
  queries, not per-row fetches.
- **Pagination is one round-trip** — `runPaginatedQuery` reads rows + `count: 'exact'` together; the
  second (count-only) query fires _only_ on a 416 out-of-range page.
- `getDueQueue` — `limit(1)` + `count: 'exact'` in one round-trip; backed by
  `memory_cards_user_id_due_at_idx`. ✅
- `isAccountEmpty` — `head: true` + `count: 'exact'` (no row payload), the cheapest existence probe. ✅
- Detail / edit / mutation reads that `select('*')` (`getNote`, `getMemoryCard`,
  `getMemoryCardForReview`, `getMemoryCardsForNote`, `rate-memory-card`) legitimately need the full
  row. ✅
- `getMemoryCardsList` ordering by `due_at` is index-backed; `getNotes` ordering by `created_at` is
  not composite-indexed but fine at scale (see F4-style note).

---

## Suggested fix order (when we move to fixing)

1. **F1** — apply the `getSubjects` slim + `SubjectOptionT` (only concrete code change worth doing).
2. **Tick the TODO** — the notes-list item is already satisfied; mark it done.
3. F2–F5 — record as "revisit at scale", no change for the MVP.
